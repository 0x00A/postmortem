# Requirements for creating a Port-Mortem.

- Each issue should contain a title.
- The time of issue creation may be different from the time of the event, so be sure to add a date and time if that is the case.
- Each issue should have a status label, either `RESOLVED` or `UNRESOLVED`.
- Be sure to assign a person to the issue so that someone will be accountable for updating its status.
